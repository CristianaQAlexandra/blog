## 1. Overview

In this article, we’ll break down the request URL and its main parts — protocol, host, path, and query string.

Then, we’ll take a closer look at path and query parameters — what they do, how they’re used, and the key differences between them.

## 2. The URL

 The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a web page or resource on the internet. It tells your browser where to go.

A URL has a few key parts:

- **Protocol** – How the data is sent (e.g., `http` or `https`)
- **Host** – The domain name (e.g., `example.com`)
- **Path** – Shows which page or resource you want (e.g., `/products/123`)
- **Query String** – Comes after ? and sends extra info using key-value pairs (e.g., `?search=shoes&page=2`)

## 3. Path Parameters

Path parameters are parts of a URL used to identify specific resources. 
They’re like placeholders in the path of the URL that get replaced with real values.
